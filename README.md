Music and physics
A sound is a vibration that propagates through air (or water) and can be decrypted by ears. For example, when you listen to your mp3 player the earphones produce vibrations that propagate through air until they reach your ears. The light is also a vibration but you can’t hear it because your ears can’t decrypt it (but your eyes can).

A vibration can be modeled by sinusoidal waveforms. In this chapter, we’ll see how music can be physically/technically described.


Pure tones vs real sounds
A pure tone is a tone with a sinusoidal waveform. A sine wave is characterized by:

Its frequency: the number of cycles per second. Its unit is the Hertz (Hz), for example 100Hz = 100 cycles per second.
Its amplitude (related to loudness for sounds): the size of each cycle.
Those characteristics are decrypted by the human ear to form a sound. Human can hear pure tones from 20 Hz to 20 000 Hz (for the best ears) and this range decreases over age. By comparison, the light you see is composed of sinewaves from 4 x 10^14 Hz to 7.9 x 10^14 Hz.


You can check the range of your ears with youtube videos like this one that displays all the pure tones from 20 Hz to 20k Hz, in my case I can’t hear anything above 15 kHz.

 

 The human perception of loudness depends on the frequency of the pure tone. For instance, a pure tone at amplitude 10 of frequency 30Hz will be quieter than a pure tone at amplitude 10 of frequency 1000Hz. Humans ears follow a psychoacoustic model, you can check this article on Wikipedia for more information.
